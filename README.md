# Off-by-One Error in Vector Access
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when accessing elements of a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access an element at the index equal to the vector's size, which is out of bounds.  This can lead to unexpected results, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
